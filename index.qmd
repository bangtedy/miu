## 2.1 Introduction 

- The neoclassical growth model by Ramsey (1928) and Solow (1956) provides the basic framework for modern macroeconomics.
- But these are models of nonmonetary economies.
- In order to explain monetary policy we have to introduce a monetary policy instrument.
- Sidrauski (1967) introduced money into the neoclassical growth model. At this time money was considered the monetary policy instrument.

## Intro (cont'd) {.scrollable}

- How can we introduce money?
  + Assume money yields utility (MIU) by incorporating into the basic neoclassical model agents whose utility depends directly on their consumption of goods and their holdings of money.
- The model allows us studying:
  + impact of money (i.e. monetary policy) on the real economy,
  + impact of money on prices,
  + optimal rate of inflation.

## 2.2 The Basic MIU Model 

- Suppose the utility function of the representative household is:

$$
U=u(c_t,z_t),
$$

- where $z_t$ is the flow of services yielded by money holdings and $c_t$ is time t per capita consumption. 

## What constitutes $z_t$?

- z should be related to something like the number of dollars, M, times their price, $1/P$, in terms of goods: $M (1/P) = M/P$. 
- If the service flow is proportional to the real value of the stock of money and $N_t$ is the population, then z can be set equal to real per capita money holdings: 
$$
z_t= \frac {M_t} {{P_t}{N_t}} \equiv m_t
$$

## The Basic MIU Model (cont'd)

The representative household seeks to maximize lifetime utility:
$$
W = \sum_{t = 1}^{\infty} \beta^t U_t = \sum_{t = 1}^{\infty} \beta^t u(c_t,m_t) \tag{2.1}
$$
where 0 < $\beta$ < 1 is a subjective rate of discount

- Equation (2.1) implies a much stronger notion of the utility provided by holding money 
than simply that the household would prefer having more money to less money.

## Constraint {.scrollable}

- Assume that households can hold money, bonds that pay a nominal interest rate $i_t$ and physical capital. 
- Physical capital produces output according to a standard neoclassical production function.
- Given its current income, its assets, and any net transfers received from the government ( $\tau_t$), the household allocates its resources among consumption, gross investment in physical capital, and gross accumulation of real money balances and bonds. 

## Constraint (cont'd)

- If the rate of depreciation of physical capital is $\delta$, the aggregate economy wide budget  constraint of the household sector takes the form 2.2

$$
\begin{multline*}
Y_t + \tau_t N_t+(1-\delta)K_{t-1}+ \frac {(1+i_{t-1}) B_{t-1}}{P_t}+ \frac {M_{t-1}}{P_t} \\
= C_t+K_t+ \frac {M_t}{P_t} + \frac {B_t}{P_t} \tag{2.2}
\end{multline*}
$$

where $Y_t$ is aggregate output, $K{t-1}$ is the aggregate stock of capital at the start of period t, and $\tau_t N_t$ is the aggregate real value of any lump-sum transfers or taxes. 


## Aggregate production function

- The aggregate production function relates output Y1 to the available capital stock $K_{t-1}$ and employment $N_1$: $Y_1 = F(K_{1-t},N_1)$
- Assuming this production function is linear homogeneous with constant returns to scale, output per capita y1 is a function of the per capita capital stock $k_{t-1}$ 

$$
y_t=f ({\frac {k_{t-1}} {1+n}}), \tag{2.3}
$$

- where n is the population growth rate (assumed to be constant).
- Note that output is produced in period t using capital carried over from period t - 1. 

## The percapita version

- Dividing both sides of the budget constraint (2.2) by population $N_t$, the per capita version becomes 2.4

$$
\omega_t \equiv f ({\frac {k_{t-1}} {1+n}}) + \tau_t + ({\frac {1 - \delta} {1+n}}) k_{t-1}+ {{(1 + i_{t-1})b_{t-1}+ m_{t-1}} \over {(1+\pi_t)}{(1+n)}} \tag{2.4}
$$

## Dynamic optimization

- The state variable for the problem is the household's initial level of resources $\omega_1$, and the value function is defined by 2.5

$$
V_{(\omega_t)}= max \{u(c_t,m_t)+\beta V(\omega_{t+1})\},  \tag{2.5}
$$

![](2.5.png){width=600px}

## Where the maximization

- where the maximization is subject to the budget constraint (2.4) and


$$
\omega_{t+1} \equiv f ({\frac {k_{t}} {1+n}}) + \tau_{t+1} + ({\frac {1 - \delta} {1+n}}) k_{t}+ {{(1 + i_{t-1})b_{t}+ m_{t}} \over {(1+\pi_{t+1})}{(1+n)}} 
$$


## FOC

- Using (2.4) to express $k_t$ as $\omega_t - c_t - m_t - b_t$ and making use of the definition of $\omega_{t+1}$, (2.5) can be written as 



$$
\begin{align*}
& V_{(\omega_t)}= max \{u(c_t,m_t) \\
& +\beta V(f \frac {({\omega_t - c_t - m_t - b_t}} {1+n}) + \tau_{t+1} + ({\frac {1 - \delta} {1+n}})({\omega_t - c_t - m_t - b_t) \\
& + {{(1 + i_{t})b_{t}+ m_{t}} \over {(1+\pi_{t+1})}{(1+n)}}}  \} 
\end{align*}
$$

## FOC

The first order necessary conditions for this problem are

$$
u_c(c_t,m_t)- \frac {\beta}{1+n}[f_k(\frac {k_t}{1+n}) + 1-\delta] V_{\omega}(\omega_{1+1})=0 \tag{2.6}
$$
$$
\frac {1+i_t} {(1+\pi_{1+t}) (1+n)} - \frac {1}{1+n}[f_k(\frac {k_t}{1+n}) + 1-\delta]=0 \tag{2.7}
$$
$$
u_c(c_t,m_t)- \frac {\beta}{1+n}[f_k(\frac {k_t}{1+n}) + 1-\delta - \frac {1}{1+\pi_{t+1}}] V_{\omega}(\omega_{1+1})=0 \tag{2.8}
$$

together with the transversality conditions

$$
\lim_{t\to\infty} \beta^t \lambda_t x_t =0, for\ x = k,b,m \tag{2.9}
$$

where At is the marginal utility of period t consumption.

## The envelope theorem

- The envelope theorem implies 2.10


$$

V_\omega (\omega_t) = \frac {\beta}{1+n}[f_k(\frac {k_t}{1+n}) + 1-\delta] - \frac {1}{1+\pi_{t+1}}] V_{\omega}(\omega_{1+1}), 

$$
which together with (2.6) yields

$$
\lambda_t \equiv u_c(c_t, m_t)= V_\omega (\omega_t) \tag{2.10}
$$

## The FOC have straightforward interpretations.

- Using (2.6) and (2.10), (2.8) can be written as 


$$
u_m(c_t,m_t)+ \frac {{\beta u_c} (c_{t+1},m_{t+1})} {{(1+\pi_{t+1})(1+n)}} = u_c(c_t,m_t) \tag{2.11}
$$
## Straightforward interpretations (cont'd)

From (2.6), (2.7), and (2.11), 


$$
\begin{align*}
\frac {{u_m} (c_t.m_t)} {{u_c}(c_t.m_t)} & = 1- [ \frac {\beta}{{(1+r_t)(1+\pi_{t+1})} }] \frac {{u_c}(c_{t+1}, m_{t+1})} {{{u_c}(c_{t}, m_{t})}} \\
& = 1- \frac {{1}} {{(1+r_t)} (1+\pi_{t+1})} \\
& = \frac {{i_t}} {{(1+i_t)}} \equiv \Upsilon_t \tag{2.12}
\end{align*}
$$

## The Fisher relationship

$$
1+i_t = [f_k(\frac {{k_t}} {{1+n}}) + 1 - \delta] (1+\pi_{t+1}) = (1+r_t)(1+\pi_{t+1}) \tag{2.13}
$$

- It expresses the gross nominal rate of interest as equal to the gross real return on capital times 1 plus the expected rate of inﬂation.

- If one notes that $(1 + x)(1 + y) \approx  1 + x + y $ when x and y are small, so (2.13) is often written as 
$$
i_t= r_t+ \pi_{t+1}
$$
