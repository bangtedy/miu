## 2.1 Introduction 

- The neoclassical growth model by @ramseyMathematicalTheorySaving1928 and @solowContributionTheoryEconomic1956 provides the basic framework for modern macroeconomics.
- But these are models of nonmonetary economies.
- In order to explain monetary policy we have to introduce a monetary policy instrument.
- @sidrauskiRationalChoicePatterns1967 introduced money into the neoclassical growth model. At this time money was considered the monetary policy instrument.

## Intro (cont'd) {.scrollable}

- How can we introduce money?
  + Assume money yields utility (MIU) by incorporating into the basic neoclassical model agents whose utility depends directly on their consumption of goods and their holdings of money.
- The model allows us studying:
  + impact of money (i.e. monetary policy) on the real economy,
  + impact of money on prices,
  + optimal rate of inflation.

## 2.2 The Basic MIU Model 

- Suppose the utility function of the representative household is:

$$
U=u(c_t,z_t),
$$

- where $z_t$ is the flow of services yielded by money holdings and $c_t$ is time t per capita consumption. 

## What constitutes $z_t$?

- z should be related to something like the number of dollars, M, times their price, $1/P$, in terms of goods: $M (1/P) = M/P$. 
- If the service flow is proportional to the real value of the stock of money and $N_t$ is the population, then z can be set equal to real per capita money holdings: 
$$
z_t= \frac {M_t} {{P_t}{N_t}} \equiv m_t
$$

## The Basic MIU Model (cont'd)

The representative household seeks to maximize lifetime utility:
$$
W = \sum_{t = 1}^{\infty} \beta^t U_t = \sum_{t = 1}^{\infty} \beta^t u(c_t,m_t) \tag{2.1}
$$
where 0 < $\beta$ < 1 is a subjective rate of discount

- Equation (2.1) implies a much stronger notion of the utility provided by holding money 
than simply that the household would prefer having more money to less money.

## Constraint {.scrollable}

- Assume that households can hold money, bonds that pay a nominal interest rate $i_t$ and physical capital. 
- Physical capital produces output according to a standard neoclassical production function.
- Given its current income, its assets, and any net transfers received from the government ( $\tau_t$), the household allocates its resources among consumption, gross investment in physical capital, and gross accumulation of real money balances and bonds. 

## Constraint {.scrollable} (cont'd)

- If the rate of depreciation of physical capital is $\delta$, the aggregate economy wide budget  constraint of the household sector takes the form 2.2

$$
\begin{multline*}
Y_t + \tau_t N_t+(1-\delta)K_{t-1}+ \frac {(1+i_{t-1}) B_{t-1}}{P_t}+ \frac {M_{t-1}}{P_t} \\
= C_t+K_t+ \frac {M_t}{P_t} + \frac {B_t}{P_t} \tag{2.2}
\end{multline*}
$$

- where $Y_t$ is aggregate output, $K{t-1}$ is the aggregate stock of capital at the start of period t, and $\tau_t N_t$ is the aggregate real value of any lump-sum transfers or taxes. 


## Aggregate production function {.scrollable}

- The aggregate production function relates output Y1 to the available capital stock $K_{t-1}$ and employment $N_1$: $Y_1 = F(K_{1-t},N_1)$
- Assuming this production function is linear homogeneous with constant returns to scale, output per capita y1 is a function of the per capita capital stock $k_{t-1}$ 

$$
y_t=f ({\frac {k_{t-1}} {1+n}}), \tag{2.3}
$$

- where n is the population growth rate (assumed to be constant).
- Note that output is produced in period t using capital carried over from period t - 1. 

## The percapita version

- Dividing both sides of the budget constraint (2.2) by population $N_t$, the per capita version becomes 2.4

$$
\omega_t \equiv f ({\frac {k_{t-1}} {1+n}}) + \tau_t + ({\frac {1 - \delta} {1+n}}) k_{t-1}+ {{(1 + i_{t-1})b_{t-1}+ m_{t-1}} \over {(1+\pi_t)}{(1+n)}} \tag{2.4}
$$

## Dynamic optimization

- The state variable for the problem is the household's initial level of resources $\omega_1$, and the value function is defined by 2.5

$$
V_{(\omega_t)}= max \{u(c_t,m_t)+\beta V(\omega_{t+1})\},  \tag{2.5}
$$

## The maximization

- where the maximization is subject to the budget constraint (2.4) and


$$
\omega_{t+1} \equiv f ({\frac {k_{t}} {1+n}}) + \tau_{t+1} + ({\frac {1 - \delta} {1+n}}) k_{t}+ {{(1 + i_{t-1})b_{t}+ m_{t}} \over {(1+\pi_{t+1})}{(1+n)}} 
$$


## FOC (1)

- Using (2.4) to express $k_t$ as $\omega_t - c_t - m_t - b_t$ and making use of the definition of $\omega_{t+1}$, (2.5) can be written as 



$$
\begin{split}
V_{(\omega_t)}= max \{u(c_t,m_t) \\
+\beta V(f \frac {({\omega_t - c_t - m_t - b_t}} {1+n}) + \tau_{t+1} + ({{\frac {1 - \delta} {1+n}}})({\omega_t - c_t - m_t - b_t) \\
+ {{(1 + i_{t})b_{t}+ m_{t}} \over {(1+\pi_{t+1})}{(1+n)}}}  \} 
\end{split}
$$

## FOC (2) {.scrollable}

The first order necessary conditions for this problem are

$$
u_c(c_t,m_t)- \frac {\beta}{1+n}[f_k(\frac {k_t}{1+n}) + 1-\delta] V_{\omega}(\omega_{1+1})=0 \tag{2.6}
$$
$$
\frac {1+i_t} {(1+\pi_{1+t}) (1+n)} - \frac {1}{1+n}[f_k(\frac {k_t}{1+n}) + 1-\delta]=0 \tag{2.7}
$$
$$
u_c(c_t,m_t)- \frac {\beta}{1+n}[f_k(\frac {k_t}{1+n}) + 1-\delta - \frac {1}{1+\pi_{t+1}}] V_{\omega}(\omega_{1+1})=0 \tag{2.8}
$$

together with the transversality conditions

$$
\lim_{t\to\infty} \beta^t \lambda_t x_t =0, for\ x = k,b,m \tag{2.9}
$$

- where At is the marginal utility of period t consumption.

## The envelope theorem

- The envelope theorem implies 2.10

$$
V_\omega (\omega_t) = \frac {\beta}{1+n}[f_k(\frac {k_t}{1+n}) + 1-\delta] - \frac {1}{1+\pi_{t+1}}] V_{\omega}(\omega_{1+1}), 
$$

- which together with (2.6) yields

$$
\lambda_t \equiv u_c(c_t, m_t)= V_\omega (\omega_t) \tag{2.10}
$$

## The FOC interpretations.

- Using (2.6) and (2.10), (2.8) can be written as 


$$
u_m(c_t,m_t)+ \frac {{\beta u_c} (c_{t+1},m_{t+1})} {{(1+\pi_{t+1})(1+n)}} = u_c(c_t,m_t) \tag{2.11}
$$

## Straightforward interpretations (cont'd)

- From (2.6), (2.7), and (2.11), 


$$
\begin{align*}
\frac {{u_m} (c_t.m_t)} {{u_c}(c_t.m_t)} & = 1- [ \frac {\beta}{{(1+r_t)(1+\pi_{t+1})} }] \frac {{u_c}(c_{t+1}, m_{t+1})} {{{u_c}(c_{t}, m_{t})}} \\
& = 1- \frac {{1}} {{(1+r_t)} (1+\pi_{t+1})} \\
& = \frac {{i_t}} {{(1+i_t)}} \equiv \Upsilon_t \tag{2.12}
\end{align*}
$$

## The Fisher relationship

$$
1+i_t = [f_k(\frac {{k_t}} {{1+n}}) + 1 - \delta] (1+\pi_{t+1}) = (1+r_t)(1+\pi_{t+1}) \tag{2.13}
$$

- It expresses the gross nominal rate of interest as equal to the gross real return on capital times 1 plus the expected rate of inﬂation.

- If one notes that $(1 + x)(1 + y) \approx  1 + x + y $ when x and y are small, so (2.13) is often written as 

$$
i_t= r_t+ \pi_{t+1}
$$


## 2.2.1 Steady-State Equilibrium

- Using (2.10) to eliminate $V_\omega (\omega^{ss})$, the equilibrium conditions:

$$
u_c(c^{ss},m^{ss}) - \beta[f_k(k^{ss})+1-\delta] u_c(c^{ss},m^{ss})=0, \tag{2.14}
$$

$$
\frac {{1+i^{ss}}} {{1+\theta}} - [f_k (k^{ss}) + 1 - \delta] = 0, \tag{2.15}
$$

# Steady-State Equilibrium (cont'd)


$$
u_m(c^{SS},m^{SS} - \beta [f_k(k^{ss}) + 1-\delta] u_c{(c^{ss}, m^{ss})} + \frac {{\beta u_c}(c^{ss},m^{ss})} {{1+\theta}} =0,  \tag{2.16}
$$ 

$$
f(k^{ss}) - \tau^{ss} + (1-\delta)k^{ss} + \frac {{m^{ss}}} {{1+\theta}} = c^{ss}+k^{ss}+m^{ss}, \tag{2.17}
$$

## The real return on capital

- net of depreciation) is $r_{ss} \equiv f_k(k_{ss} - \delta $, so (2.15) can be written as

$$
1+i^{ss}=(1+r^{ss})(1+\theta) = (1+r^{ss})(1+\pi^{ss}) \tag{2.18}
$$


## The steady-state capital-labor ratio

$$
f_k(k^{ss}) = \frac {1}{\beta} - 1 + \delta, \tag{2.19}
$$



- if the production function is Cobb-Douglass, $f(k)= k^\alpha$ for $0<\alpha<1$, then $f_k(k) = \alpha k^{\alpha-1}$ and

$$
k^{ss}=[\frac {{\alpha \beta}} {{1+\beta(\delta-1)}}]^{\frac {1}{1-\alpha}}, \tag{2.20}
$$

## The economy’s resource constraint

$$
c^{ss}=f(k^{ss}) - \delta k^{ss}, \tag{2.21}
$$


## Superneutrality 

- To understand why superneutrality holds, note from (2.10), $u_c=V_{\omega}(\omega_t)$, so using (2.6), 


$$
u_c(c_t, m_t)= \beta[f_k(k_t) + 1-\delta] u_c({c_{t+1}}, m_{t+1}}),  or
$$

$$
\frac {{u_c} (c_{t+1}, m_{t+1})} {{u_c} (c_t,m_t)} = \frac {{1/\beta}} {{f_k}(k_t) +1-\delta}. \tag{2.22}
$$


## Existence of Steady State

$$
B(m_{t+1}) \equiv \frac {\beta}{1+\theta}v_c (c^{ss})m_{t+1}= [v_C(c^{ss})-\phi_m(m_t)]m_t \equiv A(m_t), \tag{2.23}
$$

## Steady-state real balances

![](fig21.png){width=600px}

## SS with a Time-Varying Money Stock {.scrollable}

$$
u_c(c^*, m_t)=\beta [f_k(k^*)+1-\delta]u_c(c^*,m_{t+1}), \tag{2.24}
$$
$$
\frac {1+i_t}{{(1+\pi_{t+1})}} = [f_k(k^*)+1+\delta], \tag{2.25}
$$

- and (2.12) implies

$$
\frac {{u_m}(c^*,m_t)} {{u_c}(c^*,m_t)} = \frac {i_t} {1+i_t}, \tag{2.26}
$$

- and the economy's resource constraint becomes $c^* = f(k^*) - \delta k^*$.

- The evolution of the real stock of money is given by

$$
m_t={ (\frac {1+\theta_t}{1+\pi_t}) }m_{t-1}. \tag{2.27}
$$


## For (2.24) to hold requires 

- the marginal utility of consumption to rise over time such that

$$
\frac {{u_c}(c^*, m_{t+1})} {{u_c}(c^*,m_t)} = \frac {1}{\beta [f_k(k^*)+1-\delta]} > 1. \tag{2.28}
$$


## Following Fisher

- If, following @fischerCapitalAccumulationTransition1979, the utility function takes the form

$$
u_c(c,m) = \frac {(c^{1-\gamma} m^{\gamma})^{1-\eta} } {1-\eta}, \tag{2.29}
$$


## The evolve of real money balances



$$
\frac {{m_t}} {{m_{t+1}}} =\{ \frac {{1}} {{\beta[f_k(k^*) + 1-\delta]}}  \} ^\frac {1} {\gamma(1-n)}{}, \tag{2.30}
$$

## The key equilibrium condition in the MIU model

- (2.12) can be written as

$$
u_m (\frac {M_0}{P_t}) = [1 - \beta \frac {{P_t}} {{P_{t+1}}}]u_c(c), \tag{2.31}
$$

## Equilibrium inflationary path with a fixed nominal money supply

![](fig22.png)

## 2.2.3 The Interest Elasticity of Money Demand 

$$
u(c_t,m_t) =[{{ac_t}^{1-b} } +{(1-a)m_t}^{1-b}]^\frac {1}{1-b}, \tag{2.32}
$$

- and (2.12) can be written as 

$$
m_t= {(\frac {1-a}{a})}^\frac{1}{b} {(\frac {i}{1+i})}^\frac  {{-1}} {{b}} c_t, \tag{2.33}
$$

## To model empirical money demand (log specification)

$$
log \frac {M_t}{P_t} = \frac {1}{b} log (\frac {1-a}{a}) + log\ c - \frac {1}{b} log \frac {i}{1+i}, \tag{2.34}
$$

## Empirical Evidence on the Interest Elasticity of Money Demand 

## 2.2.4 Limitations 


## 2.3 The Welfare Cost of Inflation 

![](fig23.png)



## Lucas (2000)

- @lucasInflationWelfare2000 provided estimates of the welfare costs of inflation, starting with the following specification of the instantaneous utility function: 

$$
u(c,m)= \frac {1}{1-\sigma} \{ [c\vartheta \frac {m}{c} ]^{1-\sigma } -1 \} \tag{2.35}
$$

- With this utility function, (2.12) becomes

$$
\frac {{u_m}} {{u_c}} = \frac {{\vartheta'}(x)} {{\vartheta(x)}- x\vartheta'(x)} = \frac{i}{1+i} = \Upsilon,  \tag{2.36}
$$

## If this cost is denoted 

- $w \Upsilon$, it is defined by

$$
u(1+w(\Upsilon), m(\Upsilon)) \equiv (1,m^*), \tag{2.37}
$$
- where $m(\Upsilon)$ denotes the solution of (2.36) for real money balances evaluated at steadystate consumption c = 1

$$
w\Upsilon = \sqrt {\beta \Upsilon}. \tag{2.38}
$$

## The welfare costs for two alternative specifications of money demand

$$
ln(m) = ln(A) - \eta\ ln (i); \tag{2.39}
$$
$$
ln(m)= ln(B) - \xi i. \tag{2.40}
$$
